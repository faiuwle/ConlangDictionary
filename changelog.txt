+ Lexique Pro input and output

3/17/14
- Adding a phoneme now also adds a default spelling.
- Word tab is now alphabetical.
- Fixed bug with word tab not updating things correctly.
- Fixed bug with editing features not resulting in parses afterwards.

3/15/14
- Massive backend overhaul: now uses local SQLite database.
- Search is on the word tab now.
- Phonemes now have features; words have features instead of type/subtype.
  You can import and export features independently from the dictionary.
- Discovered and killed insideous pointer-related logic error that may have 
  caused various phoneme problems in newly-created dictionaries that had not
  yet been loaded from a savefile.  But then I rewrote the backend to not use
  pointers anyway, so uh.  It was still something I fixed.
- Phonotactics can now be specified using natural classes.
- There is now a button for translating XSAMPA into IPA on the phonemes tab.
  (Lookup table compiled by Zoris and borrowed from his ConlangIDE code.)
- You can now tell CD to override Windows' native codepage and import CSV files
  using UTF-8.
- Bloated last tab has been reorganized into more traditional menu system.
- You can now set the default path that CD will try to open files in.
- You can now specify a file to open on the command line.

Version 0.2
5/24/10
- Save/Load tab is smarter about suggesting files to save to.
- Phonotactics will now ignore specified characters.
- Type is now shown on the wordlist.
- Slightly context-sensitive phonology parsing implemented.
- Application font can now be set on the last page (restart to actually see changes).
  Default is DejaVu Sans.
- Manually adding <squareBrackets /> to the .cdic file (inside the top-level <conlang> tag)
  will cause the dictionary to use square brackets instead of slashes.

5/20/10
- Wordlists can now be imported from Lexique Pro.

5/11/10
- Words input from text files will now accept punctuation and spaces in the word
  field.
- Multiple phonemes and words can be selected (with shift) and manipulated simultaneously.
- Edit phonology dialog will allow you to edit phonology when phonotactics are turned
  off.

3/13/10
- Deleting phonemes bug fixed for reals now.
- Words generated with no phonology will now be analyzed as CVCV(C).  Yeah, it sucks.

2/26/10
- Wordlists can now be loaded from or saved to a text or CSV file.
- Partial wordlists can now be loaded from existing dictionary files.
- Language name is now stored in savefile (set it on the last tab)
- It is now possible to opt out of phonotactical restrictions on the phonotactics
  page.
- Sanity check: Attempting to generate more than 1000 clusters on the phonotactics
  page now results in an error message (if you need more than about 500, you're probably
  better off just opting out of phonotactics restrictions anyway).
- The dialog for choosing sequences of phonemes has been optimized for displaying
  larger number numbers of sequences (YMMV based on your screen size).
- Deleting phonemes and suprasegmentals that are referenced in many places will now result
  in all references being properly removed rather than a crash.

(First update)
- Suprasegmentals tab added.
- Phonotactics tab added.
- A couple buttons on the words tab are now properly disabled in circumstances
  where clicking them would cause a crash.
- Phonological representations are now loaded correctly.
- Problem where changing the spelling of a word did not change its place in the
  list was fixed.
- It is now possible to specify an alphabetic order for phonemes.
- Savefile format is now in XML.
